## Notes on Day 3

### Access Variable Value

There are two ways to access the value of the variable:

- `$<Variable name>`. This is the way for lazy scripter and may come with its own challenge when we need to prefix or postfix the variable like `$WORKing` where `WORK` is the real variable.
- `${<Variable name>}`. Perfect and recommended way to access value of variable.

One Convention:

- Capitalize all the letters in variables' name. Do this because capitalization matters.

Change a variable's value by reassignment.
